# Raspberry pi clock
This project can show you what time is it, via LEDs.
## requirements:
1- Raspberry pi <br>
2- 5 Led  <br>
3- 330 resistor  <br>
4- jumper wires <br>

# How to use?
## Step 1:
<p>connect your raspberry pi to breadboard and connect 3v3 pin to + side of breadboard  and GND pin to - side, via jumper wires.</p>

## Step 2:
<p>connect  resistors to GP 14,15,16,17,18 pins and then connect them to the possitive side of leds.</p>

## Step 3:
<p>connect negative side of led to negative side of breadboard via wires.</p>

## Step 4:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Ml06py/raspberry-pi-tools.git
```

## Step 5:
```
$ cd raspberry-pi-tools/raspberry-clock
```

## Step 6:
execute the file on your raspberry pi.
